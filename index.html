          <p>
            Creative, ambitious, and inspiring. My out-the-box approach to problem solving and steadfast determination pushes me to innovate on the exceptional!
            <br>
            I've dipped my toes into many different fields and found a small home in each of them with my ambitions taking me anywhere from programming to illustration. 
            The desire to leave an impact with my work is what continues to drive its creation, figueing out the answers to the many questions that lie on the path to that goal.
            I'm curently working on developing my skill sets in order to take on even greater challenges in these creative spaces, ultimately aiming to shake up the game development 
            space through collaborative effort and shared vision.

            <h1>Demos</h1>
            <p>
              Video games and the experiences they can offer are a huge part of what drove me into the tech space from such a young age. 
              The stories and moments that are created through their unique methods of interactivity set in stone my desire to create and share them with others. 
              It's my hope that what I create will someday have a meaningful impact on the lives of those that interact with my work, much like others did for me.  
            </p>
  
            <p>  
              The following are some examples of my work in Unityâ„¢ during my time at university. 
              Though these projects act more as tech demos, they still hold a special place for me as some of my first true undertakings as a game designer and developer.

              <h3>Out-Run</h3>
              <p>
                Tasked to create a "lane runner" style game and armed with a very limited knowledge of 3D modeling, I chose a theme I felt would be both manageable and fit the meditative gameplay of the genre, "Outrun".
                The game sends you through an endless neon horison, where you will need fast reflexes and quick thinking to outmaneuvere not only the enviroment but the big bad bosses that stand in your way.

                <p>During a time, I dipped my toes into the world of streaming and had the opportunity to experiment with new programs, such as After Effects.
                  It also gave me a reason to create a series of visually coherent designs to use across my page.
                  Here you can see a few of the assets I made for my Twitch page.

                <p>I spent a lot of time designing assets for board and card games in college. 
                  I still enjoy tabletop games and love making and designing assets for my favorite games like D&D and Magic: The Gathering. 
                  Here are some of the boxes and cards I designed for my game, Rival Shards.

                <p>The following slides are splash arts for two game concepts I worked on. 
                  Glass is an action adventure style game, focusing on colabrative gameplay in a similar vein as 'It Takes Two' and the new game 'Split Fiction'. 
                  The game places a heavy weight on its narrative and developing the two main charaters through its RPG progression.

                <h3>Splash Screen: Eldritch Dark</h3>
                <p>Eldricth Dark was designed as a gritty game of social deception, inspired by the lovecraft mythos and table top RPGs such as Call of Cthulhu. 
                  It aims to evoke a similar play style as games like 'Among Us', but with a more long form gameplay loop.
